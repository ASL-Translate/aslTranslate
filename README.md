This project allows the translation of English into an ASL sign by giving the 
user a GIF file showing the live signing of an ASL term. It also allows a user 
to use filters to search for ASL signs that can be translated back to English 
using the five parameters of handshape, location, movement, orientation, and 
facial expression :)
